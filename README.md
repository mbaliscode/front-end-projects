# Front-End Projects

These are front-end projects I created while doing the full stack developer course from Scrimba. These projects are personalized to my own liking.

1. **About Me**  
   [https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/01_about_me/](https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/01_about_me/)  
   A simple HTML about me site. Although this was not part of the Scrimba course, it was one of my very first projects I coded.

2. **Happy Birthday Gift Card**  
   [https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/02_happy_birthday_gift_card/](https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/02_happy_birthday_gift_card/)  
   A fun project to wish someone a happy birthday by including gifs when you hover over them. An interesting new struggle for me was centering the elements.

_(More projects coming soon...)_
