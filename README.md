# Front-End Projects

These are front-end projects I created while doing the full stack developer course from Scrimba. Each project is personalized to my own style. There are two types of projects: _normal projects_ and _solo projects_. Normal projects are follow-along tutorials with the instructor, while solo projects are built from scratch based on a project brief — no guidance from the instructor.

## Projects

1. [**About Me**](https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/01_about_me/)  
   HTML | CSS
   A simple HTML "About Me" page. Although this wasn’t part of the Scrimba course, it was one of my very first projects and helped me get comfortable with basic HTML structure.

2. [**Happy Birthday Gift Card**](https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/02_happy_birthday_gift_card/)  
   HTML | CSS
   A fun project to wish someone a happy birthday by showing gifs when you hover over them. One of the challenges I faced was learning how to center elements properly.

3. [**Solo Project – Hometown Homepage (Durban)**](https://mbaliscode.github.io/front-end-projects/03_hometown_homepage_durban/)  
   HTML | CSS
   I built this project to showcase my hometown, Durban. It's a simple homepage that uses flexbox to align and center elements (something I had struggled with prior) and sectioning different parts of a page.
