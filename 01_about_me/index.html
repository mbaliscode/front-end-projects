        Hi there, my name is Mbali Mtambo and I love to code. I am originally
        from South Africa and now reside in Belgium.

    <div id="interest">
      <h2>A mysterious language that lead to curiosity</h2>
      <p>
        My interest in tech came about when I was working for a tech company
        based in Belgium. Although I was not in a tech role, I became interested
        in learning the "cool stuff" they were doing, the "mysterious" language
        that they were having amongst each other. Well lo and behold curiosity
        took over and now I am here, learning and growing.

    <div id="practicality">
      <h2>If I cannot see it I cannot build it</h2>
      <p>
        What excites me the most about this journey is that I am a very
        visual/practical learner, so this allows me to actually visualize and
        see what I'm trying to achieve. If I do not see it, I cannot build it.
        It excites me to be able to break down a problem and solve it with code.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I love to code in a nutshell:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>See what I am building in real time.</li>
        <li>Room for growth as I love to learn.</li>
        <li>A code is a code. There's no misinterpretations.</li>
        <li>Structure.</li>
